# office_temp

My coworkers often complain that our office is too hot or cold. I wanted to collect data to see the fluctuations in temperature, so I programmed a Raspberry Pi to collect and store the temperature. The current temperature will be displayed on an LED matrix and stored to a file for possible visualizations later on.

To make things more interesting, the LED matrix will also display the current time/date, weather in Seattle, and Starbucks stock price. 

## Future enhancements
* Add LED animations
* Add messages to display on special days (birthdays, anniversaries, holidays)
